/**
 * A table model which can be sorted by a particular column index or by a set of
 * columns.
 * <p>
 * The single column sort method is to cater for the common paradigm where a
 * user may click on a particular column header to indicate that they wish to
 * sort by it. The table model may have its own natural sort sequence already.
 * It is up to the implementation as to how it interprets the semantics of a
 * user sorting by a particular column in such a case. A common implementation
 * would be to order by the new column first, followed by the existing natural
 * sort order.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The multiple column sort method is for a more specific requirement that the
 * table is sorted by the given columns in the order supplied; this gives greater
 * control over how the contents of the table model are sorted at the expense of
 * having to do more work in the controller.
 * </p>
